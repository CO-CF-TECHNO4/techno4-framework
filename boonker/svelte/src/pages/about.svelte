      techno4 - is a free and open source HTML mobile framework to develop hybrid mobile apps or
      web apps with iOS or Android (Material) native look and feel. It is also an indispensable
      prototyping apps tool to show working app prototype as soon as possible in case you need to.
      techno4 is created by Vladimir Kharlampidi.

    <p>
      The main approach of the techno4 is to give you an opportunity to create iOS and Android
      (Material) apps with HTML, CSS and JavaScript easily and clear. techno4 is full of freedom.
      It doesn't limit your imagination or offer ways of any solutions somehow. techno4 gives you
      freedom!
    </p>
    <p>
      techno4 is not compatible with all platforms. It is focused only on iOS and Android
      (Material) to bring the best experience and simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      techno4 is definitely for you if you decide to build iOS and Android hybrid app (Cordova or
      Capacitor) or web app that looks like and feels as great native iOS or Android (Material)
      apps.
